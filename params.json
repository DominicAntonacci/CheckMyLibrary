{"name":"booksfordc","tagline":"Bringing the Public Library to DC","body":"![banner](https://github.com/emanuelfeld/booksfordc/blob/master/banners/PromoLarge.png)\r\n\r\nAssorted projects aimed at making the DC Public Library's resources more accessible and useful for DC residents. Drop me a line [@evonfriedland](https://twitter.com/evonfriedland) if you're interested.\r\n\r\n##@booksfordc##\r\n\r\n###Catalog feed###\r\nDue to issues with the DCPL's OPAC technology, RSS feeds for its catalog do not syndicate properly. The script in scraper.py is run hourly on ScraperWiki to generate a Twitter feed of new additions to the DCPL book catalog. Follow [@booksfordc](https://twitter.com/booksfordc). You can also subscribe to a daily or weekly email digest of new resources using [these IFTTT recipes](https://ifttt.com/p/evonfriedland/shared).\r\n\r\n###Twitter bot###\r\nTwitter users can also use the [@booksfordc](https://twitter.com/booksfordc) account to quickly query the library catalog. To look up a book, send a tweet in the form ```@booksfordc search: book_title book_author``` or ```@booksfordc s: book_title book_author```. For ebook lookup, do ```@booksfordc ebook search: book_title book_author``` or ```@booksfordc ebk s: book_title book_author```. And for an audiobook search, do ```@booksfordc audio search: book_title book_author``` or ```@booksfordc abk s: book_title book_author```.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, the bot will accept any mention structured:\r\n\r\n    @booksfordc resource_type search_init search_terms\r\n\r\nWhere ```resource_type``` is ```b```, ```bk```, or ```book``` for physical books, ```e```, ```ebk```, ```e-bk```, ```ebook```, or ```e-book``` for electronic books, or ```a```, ```abk```, ```a-bk```, ```audio```, ```audiobook```, or ```audio-book``` for audiobooks, where ```search_init``` is one of ```f```,```f:```,```s```, ```s:```, ```search```, ```search:```, ```find```, or ```find:```, and where ```search_terms``` includes the book title and/or author or the book's ISBN. An author and title combination will yield the best results. If you only use one of those, you're more likely to end up with multiple possible matches. If you use the ISBN, you run the risk of an erroneous 'Not found' response, since the DCPL might have a different edition (with different ISBN). If you do use ISBN, it should be ISBN-13 and not ISBN-10. The latter will not work. \r\n\r\nThe bot will then respond directly to the account that sent the query saying whether it found a match (or multiple possible matches) and with the search/resource URL.\r\n\r\n###Browser plug-in###\r\nA Chrome extension that displays library holdings and availability when browsing books on Amazon, Goodreads, or Barnes & Noble.
