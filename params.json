{"name":"booksfordc","tagline":"Bringing the Public Library to DC","body":"![booksfordc_banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emanuelfeld/booksfordc/gh-pages/banners/PromoLarge.png)\r\n\r\nBooks for DC (aka booksfordc) is an ongoing initiative aimed at making the DC Public Library's resources more accessible to DC residents by bringing them to the platforms they already use.\r\n\r\n##Browser plug-in##\r\nWith the booksfordc browser extension, you can now easily determine the availability of books and ebooks at the DCPL as you browse Amazon, Goodreads, and Barnes & Noble. Download for free for Chrome or Firefox:\r\n\r\n[![chrome_logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emanuelfeld/emanuelfeld.github.io/master/assets/chrome32.png)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/booksfordc/plbkclaloadjhljkijjnlingopbahndg) [![firefox_logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emanuelfeld/emanuelfeld.github.io/master/assets/firefox32.png)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/booksfordc/)\r\n\r\n##Catalog feed##\r\nWish you could keep up with the latest additions to the DCPL book catalog? Now you can. Just follow the [@booksfordc](https://twitter.com/booksfordc) Twitter account, which tweets out new books at the DCPL as they come in. In addition to this feed, you can subscribe to a daily or weekly email digest of new holdings using [these IFTTT recipes](https://ifttt.com/p/evonfriedland/shared).\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin: 0 auto\"><a class=\"twitter-timeline\" href=\"https://twitter.com/booksfordc\" data-widget-id=\"581949709092257793\">Tweets by @booksfordc</a>\r\n<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+\"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></div>\r\n\r\n##Twitter bot##\r\nTwitter users can also use the [@booksfordc](https://twitter.com/booksfordc) account to quickly query the library catalog.\r\n\r\nTo look up a book, send a tweet in the form ```@booksfordc search: book_title book_author``` or ```@booksfordc s: book_title book_author```. For ebook lookup, do ```@booksfordc ebook search: book_title book_author``` or ```@booksfordc ebk s: book_title book_author```. And for an audiobook search, do ```@booksfordc audio search: book_title book_author``` or ```@booksfordc abk s: book_title book_author```. \r\n\r\nThe bot will then respond directly to the account that sent the query saying whether it found a match (or multiple possible matches) and with the search/resource URL.\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin: 0 auto\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/evonfriedland\">@evonfriedland</a> Found: <a href=\"https://t.co/6DVjQPnIWE\">https://t.co/6DVjQPnIWE</a></p>&mdash; booksfordc (@booksfordc) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/booksfordc/status/581946138376441856\">March 28, 2015</a></blockquote>\r\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\r\n\r\nIn actuality, the bot will accept any mention structured:\r\n\r\n    @booksfordc resource_type search_init search_terms\r\n\r\nWhere ```resource_type``` is ```b```, ```bk```, or ```book``` for physical books, ```e```, ```ebk```, ```e-bk```, ```ebook```, or ```e-book``` for electronic books, or ```a```, ```abk```, ```a-bk```, ```audio```, ```audiobook```, or ```audio-book``` for audiobooks, where ```search_init``` is one of ```f```,```f:```,```s```, ```s:```, ```search```, ```search:```, ```find```, or ```find:```, and where ```search_terms``` includes the book title and/or author or the book's ISBN. \r\n\r\nAn author and title combination search will yield the best results. If you only use one of those, you're more likely to end up with multiple possible matches. If you use the ISBN, you run the risk of an erroneous 'Not found' response, since the DCPL might have a different edition (with different ISBN). If you do use ISBN, it should be ISBN-13 and not ISBN-10. The latter will not work. \r\n\r\n##In the news##\r\n\r\nWAMU 88.5: [New Browser Extension May Get You Going To The D.C.
